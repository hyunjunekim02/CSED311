CSED311 Computer Architecture Lab Assignments (2023 Spring)

This course deal with comupter architecture including CPU, Cache, Memory.
Lab assignments are written in Verilog and deal with some topics below

Lab1 - ALU and Vending Machine
Lab2 - Single-Cycle CPU
Lab3 - Multi-Cycle CPU
Lab4 - 5-Stage Pipelined CPU(4-1: w/o controlflow, 4-2: w/ controlflow)
Lab5 - CPU with Cache Memory(Developed from Lab4)

Be careful. There might be some minor errors in those codes.
