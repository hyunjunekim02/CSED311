# CSED311 Computer Architecture

Welcome to the repository for the Computer Architecture Lab Assignments for the Spring 2023 session of CSED311 @ POSTECH! This course dives into the depth of computer architecture, covering key concepts such as CPU, Cache, and Memory.

## Overview

The lab assignments are implemented in Verilog and traverse various facets of computer architecture:

1. **Lab 1**: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Vending Machine
2. **Lab 2**: Single-Cycle CPU
3. **Lab 3**: Multi-Cycle CPU
4. **Lab 4**: 5-Stage Pipelined CPU
   - Lab 4-1: Without control flow
   - Lab 4-2: With control flow
5. **Lab 5**: CPU with Cache Memory (Developed from Lab 4)

Each lab builds upon the knowledge and skills developed in the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture concepts.
